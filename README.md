# misc_python
miscelaneous python I've thrown together and collected over time
some stuff might be eventually moved into other projects, idk

## Buspirate Demo
rewrote the python script for interacting with Buspirate for python3. Should be a good jumping off point for scripting out hardware attacks via buspirate

## Keylogger
I think this came from Black Hat Go - uses some dependencies so more of an exercise than anything

## Nmap Parser
Kinda useful, takes a .gnmap output and converts it into a csv file
